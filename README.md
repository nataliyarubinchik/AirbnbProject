# AirbnbProject
Repository for Udacity Airbnb Project.

## Installations
My code is written entirely within a Jupyter notebook via Anaconda, using Python 3. 
All libraries utilized were available through Anaconda:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Sklearn

## Project Motivations
My background in economics and psychology helped shape the questions I had using open-source Airbnb data of Seattle listings.
I was interested in learning more about what variables help predict how much an Airbnb listing would cost per night, what impacts how guests rate the value of the listing, and what determined whether a host receives the accolade of 'Superhost'.

## File Descriptions
*listings* - dataset downloaded from Kaggle, with Seattle Airbnb data
*Project1* - code written to clean *listings* data and perform analyses
*blog_link* - blog discussing findings of analysis

## How to interact with this project
Any feedback regarding how the analysis was performed or recommendations for how to improve the code is greatly appreciated!

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Airbnb for providing the data through Kaggle. I would also like to acknowledge that certain functions in the code came from the Udacity Data Scientist course.
